# 🕹️ Idle GitHub — Incremental Game Based on GitHub Activity

## 📌 Project Summary

You are an AI developer tasked with creating a browser-based incremental (idle clicker) game. The goal is to simulate the journey of a developer leveling up through GitHub contributions. The player's GitHub stats influence their in-game growth, upgrades, and prestige mechanics.

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Objectives

### 1. 🧠 Define Core Game Logic

- Create a `Player` object to track in-game currency (e.g., `commits`, `stars`, `repos`).
- Implement a "Click to Code" button that adds `commits` to the player’s balance.
- Create an idle system that automatically generates `commits` over time.

### 2. 🏗️ Build Basic UI Components

- UI should include:
  - Commit counter display
  - Manual button to “Write Code”
  - Upgrade shop with generators and buffs
  - Tabs or sections for Stats / Achievements / GitHub Sync

### 3. 🛍️ Create Upgrade and Automation Systems

- Generators:
  - Intern → +0.1 commits/sec
  - Junior Dev → +1 commit/sec
  - Senior Dev → +5 commits/sec
  - CI Bot → +10 commits/sec

- Upgrades:
  - “Better IDE” → Boost click efficiency
  - “Test Coverage” → Multiplies generator output
  - “Hackathon Boost” → Temporary speed boost

- Add dynamic cost scaling to upgrades.

### 4. ⏲️ Implement Idle Timers

- Use a loop to run the game tick:
  - Every second, calculate resources gained from automation.
  - Add to player's balance.
  - Update UI in real time.

### 5. 🔄 Create Save/Load System

- Save game state in local storage (JSON).
- Load progress automatically on reload.
- Add manual save/load button (bonus: export/import as text blob).

### 6. 🧬 Integrate GitHub API (Optional but Powerful)

- Let users enter their GitHub username.
- Pull stats like:
  - Public repo count
  - Commit history
  - Star count
  - Follower count
- Use this data to:
  - Auto-boost the player's starting resources.
  - Unlock special in-game upgrades based on real milestones.

### 7. 🧠 Add Achievements System

- Create a list of goals:
  - “First 100 Commits”
  - “Launched a Repo”
  - “10 Stars Collected”
- Trigger a popup or badge when each is achieved.

### 8. 🌀 Design Prestige Loop

- Implement a soft-reset system:
  - Player can "retire and start fresh."
  - In return, they gain `XP` or `Influence` which adds permanent multipliers.

### 9. 🎨 Polish UI and UX

- Add retro/pixel-style visuals or terminal-like aesthetic.
- Make upgrade animations or simple progress bar fills.
- Add hover tooltips to explain each item.
- Optional: Add sound effects or background music toggle.

### 10. 🚀 Final Touches and Launch

- Add favicon, title, meta info.
- Create a README explaining the game.
- Host it publicly.
- Add social share image.
- Submit it to Product Hunt, Reddit, and dev communities.

## 🔁 Future Features (Stretch Goals)

- Weekly Events (e.g. “Hacktoberfest Boost”)
- Leaderboards (compare GitHub data)
- Collaborators system (invite friends to auto-generate together)
- Random GitHub trivia/facts
- Themes (dark mode, matrix mode, GitHub light/dark)
